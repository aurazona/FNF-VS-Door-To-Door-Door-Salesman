THINGS YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW:

IF YOU'VE SPOTTED A BUG IN THIS MOD, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT MAKE AN ISSUE ON THE KADE ENGINE GITHUB. This isn't a stock KE build, so your report would probably go unnoticed/deleted, plus if it's something that I can fix, chances are I won't see it. If you have a bug to report, please make an issue in the github repo below.

This .exe is a custom kade engine build, meaning that stuff like settings and scores won't be carried over to this mod. You might also notice some things look different, like the menu being smooth and an extra option. This is because this project was started at commit 990c59a, meaning you get to see some neat KE features early. Lucky you!

We're open source! Come check out the github here: https://github.com/aurazona/FNF-VS-Door-To-Door-Door-Salesman

If you enjoy the mod, feel free to follow us at @pizzapancakess_ and @TheAurazona on twitter! We're usually cooking up something neat, so swing by and see what's going on!

You might notice another folder called 'extra' in this directory. This has some pretty neat docs that include stuff like how to make D2DDS' voice in FL studio (which i really think mod creators should do more, open source your voices lmao) and other neat things!
