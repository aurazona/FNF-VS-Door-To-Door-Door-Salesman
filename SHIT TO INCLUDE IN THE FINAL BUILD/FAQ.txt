Aura here, time for some frequently asked questions.

Q: Why sonic music?

A: Short answer: I'm lazy and I am not a musician. 

Long answer: I actually made Ajar before the mod was even an idea. I was fucking around with FL studio, adding BF's voice into stuff and thought 'hey, this actually sounds kinda good.' I ran it by pizzapancakess_, she said 'wouldn't it be funny if we made a mod' and we ended up here. I decided to continue remixing sonic music as I have a shitton of sonic MIDIs on my computer (don't ask why) and it kinda just fit D2DDS's vibe.

Q: Why no zip???? make a zip!!!!

A: Not exactly a question, but look up 7zip and get back to me.

Q: How did you do [insert feature here] or [insert other feature here]?

A: We're open source, go find out for yourself!

Q: Update when????

A: Unless it's a bug fix or there's overwhelming demand for a new week, neverâ„¢.
